All results (in 12 Data Supplements) are available as a ZIP archive (58.3 MBytes).Data Supplement 1 (DS01): CAST-filtered Y-Nup sequences from Drosophila melanogaster used in this study (referred as the query set), in FASTA format (see also Supplementary Table 1).Data Supplement 2 (DS02): CAST-filtered regions for the query set providing detailed statistics per region masked, as CAST output text format.Data Supplement 3 (DS03): NCBI PSI-BLAST results at various iteration levels for each of the nine sequences of the query set, and resulting multiple sequence alignments with specified redundancy levels, in ZIP archive format. Alignments define implicit profile hidden Markov models (HMMs)98, that can be built with appropriate tools.Data Supplement 4 (DS04): Sequence identity distributions in this analysis, see also Supplementary Figure 2 of the manuscript, in Microsoft Excel® format (XLS).Data Supplement 5 (DS05): Linker sequences of the multi-domain proteins detected in DS03 used for the validation of genuine domain associations, in FASTA format.Data Supplement 6 (DS06): NCBI TBLASTN results against nucleotide databases NR/HTGS/EST (and BLASTP against nrdb) with the linker sequences of multi-domain proteins in DS05 used as queries, in ZIP archive format.Data Supplement 7 (DS07): Non-nucleoporin domains matching multi-domain members of the query set, manually collected and labeled accordingly, to assist validated automatic clustering (corresponding to the entries of Supplementary Table 2), in FASTA format.Data Supplement 8 (DS08): Taxonomy distribution of the 27 ‘external’ domains detected in this study (see DS06), from NCBI BLAST output, in text format.Data Supplement 9 (DS09): Clustering results using MCL for the homologies detected by the query set (Supplementary Table 1 and Figure 1), in ZIP archive format.Data Supplement 10 (DS10): Expression data files for human and mouse across multiple tissues, in Microsoft Excel® Open XML format (XLSX).Data Supplement 11 (DS11): Protein interaction information from public databases including nucleoporins, known interactions and the domain associations reported herein, in BioLayout format; annotation embedded in the text file.Data Supplement 12 (DS12): All sequences with significant homology to the query set discovered in this study, including multi-domain proteins, in FASTA format as well as CAST-filtered versions, in ZIP archive format.
